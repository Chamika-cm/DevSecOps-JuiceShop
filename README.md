### MEMBER 3 PART - FIX VULNERABILITIES 

### 1. SQL Injection (SQLi) Remediation
- **Vulnerable File:** `routes/login.ts`
- **The Vulnerability:** 
  The original code was building SQL queries using direct string concatenation with user inputs. Because of this, attackers could easily exploit it by typing payloads like `' OR 1=1 --` into the login fields, letting them bypass authentication and log in as an admin without even knowing the password.
- **The Remediation / Fix:** 
  We secured the login route by replacing the vulnerable string-based query with a **parameterized query** using Sequelize placeholders (`?`). Additionally, we integrated `security.hash()` to safely hash the password before checking it against the database. This ensures that user inputs are treated strictly as data rather than executable SQL commands.
